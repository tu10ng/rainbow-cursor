* rgb cursor
make your cursor rgb!

+to improve your coding effectiveness+

the code is ugly and need refactor/improvements, issues and prs are very welcome
* usage
add this directory to your load-path, and then require
example:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/rgb-cursor/")
(require 'rgb-cursor)

#+end_src
then try ~M-x rgb-cursor-mode~

to enable rgb-cursor-mode on startup, add this to your init file:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(rgb-cursor-mode 1)
#+end_src

* known errors
- This package wont work under terminal.

* improvements needed
- the logic of `rgb-cursor-enable'
- the method of store/restore config
- i dont know how to remove `rgb-cursor-color-pointer' from  `rgb-cursor-change-color'
